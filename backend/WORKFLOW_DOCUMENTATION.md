# Approval Workflow Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Approval Workflow Engine is a comprehensive system for managing expense approvals in the Expense Reimbursement Management System. It supports dynamic rule-based approvals, currency conversion, auto-escalation, and role-based access control.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Models**
   - `ApprovalRule`: Defines approval workflows based on amount thresholds
   - `ApprovalRecord`: Tracks approval history and decisions
   - `Expense`: Enhanced with workflow fields (urgent, current_stage, escalation_date)

2. **Workflow Engine** (`auth/workflow.py`)
   - Currency conversion utilities
   - Rule evaluation logic
   - Workflow advancement functions
   - Auto-escalation system

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Expense submission with workflow
   - Approval/rejection actions
   - History and reporting
   - Admin override functionality

## üìã Approval Rules

### Default Rules

| Rule ID | Amount Range | Approval Sequence | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| R1 | ‚â§ $5,000 | Manager only | Low amount expenses |
| R2 | $5,001 - $25,000 | Manager ‚Üí Admin | Medium amount expenses |
| R3 | > $25,000 | Manager ‚Üí Admin | High amount expenses |

### Conditional Rules

- **Urgent Expenses**: Bypass manager, go directly to Admin
- **Multiple Managers**: Require 70% approval (configurable)
- **Admin Override**: Admins can approve/reject any expense

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### 1. Expense Submission
```
Employee submits expense ‚Üí Currency conversion ‚Üí Rule matching ‚Üí Workflow initiation
```

### 2. Approval Stages
```
Manager Stage ‚Üí Admin Stage (if required) ‚Üí Final Approval
```

### 3. Status Transitions
- `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `approved`/`rejected`

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### Expense Submission
```http
POST /api/auth/expenses/submit/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Office Supplies",
  "description": "Purchase of office supplies",
  "amount": 2500.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "expense_date": "2024-01-15",
  "urgent": false
}
```

### Get Pending Approvals
```http
GET /api/auth/expenses/pending/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Approve Expense
```http
POST /api/auth/expenses/{expense_id}/approve-workflow/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "comment": "Approved by manager"
}
```

### Reject Expense
```http
POST /api/auth/expenses/{expense_id}/reject-workflow/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "comment": "Insufficient documentation"
}
```

### Admin Override
```http
POST /api/auth/expenses/{expense_id}/override/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "action": "approve",
  "comment": "Admin override - urgent business need"
}
```

### Get Expense History
```http
GET /api/auth/expenses/history/?status=approved&date_from=2024-01-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## üí± Currency Conversion

The system automatically converts expenses to the company's default currency using the ExchangeRate API:

```python
# Example conversion
amount_usd = convert_currency(1000, 'EUR', 'USD')
# Returns: 1085.50 (approximate)
```

### Supported Features
- Real-time exchange rates
- Fallback to original amount if conversion fails
- Automatic conversion on expense submission

## ‚è∞ Auto-Escalation

### Escalation Rules
- **Time Limit**: 48 hours for manager approval
- **Auto-Escalation**: Moves to admin if manager doesn't act
- **Cron Job**: Runs every hour to check escalations

### Setup Cron Job
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every hour)
0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py check_escalations
```

### Manual Escalation Check
```http
POST /api/auth/escalations/check/
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### 1. Low Amount Expense (‚â§ $5,000)
```python
# Employee submits
expense_data = {
    "title": "Office Supplies",
    "amount": 2500.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "urgent": False
}

# Workflow: Employee ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Approved
# No admin approval required
```

### 2. High Amount Expense (> $25,000)
```python
# Employee submits
expense_data = {
    "title": "Software License",
    "amount": 50000.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "urgent": False
}

# Workflow: Employee ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Admin ‚Üí Approved
# Requires both manager and admin approval
```

### 3. Urgent Expense
```python
# Employee submits
expense_data = {
    "title": "Emergency Travel",
    "amount": 15000.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "urgent": True
}

# Workflow: Employee ‚Üí Admin ‚Üí Approved
# Bypasses manager approval
```

## üìä Response Format

### Approval Response
```json
{
  "expense_id": 123,
  "status": "Approved",
  "current_stage": "Completed",
  "next_approver": null,
  "approval_record_id": 456
}
```

### Workflow Status

}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Test Script
```bash
python test_workflow.py
```

### Test Scenarios
1. ‚úÖ Company and user registration
2. ‚úÖ Default approval rules setup
3. ‚úÖ Low amount expense (Manager only)
4. ‚úÖ High amount expense (Manager ‚Üí Admin)
5. ‚úÖ Urgent expense (Admin only)
6. ‚úÖ Admin override functionality
7. ‚úÖ Expense history tracking

## üìà Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Approval rates by role
- Average processing time
- Escalation frequency
- Currency conversion success rate

### Dashboard Integration
The workflow system integrates with existing dashboards:
- Manager Dashboard: Shows pending approvals
- Admin Dashboard: Shows all company expenses
- Employee Dashboard: Shows personal expense history

## üîí Security

### Role-Based Access
- **Employees**: Can submit expenses, view own history
- **Managers**: Can approve expenses from their set
- **Admins**: Can approve any expense, override decisions

### Validation
- Amount thresholds enforced
- Currency conversion validated
- User permissions checked
- Audit trail maintained

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. Django 4.0+
2. PostgreSQL (recommended)
3. Redis (for caching, optional)
4. Celery (for background tasks, optional)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Currency conversion API
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_URL=https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/

# Escalation settings

ESCALATION_CHECK_INTERVAL=3600  # seconds
```

### Database Setup
```bash
python manage.py migrate

```

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Rule Design
- Keep rules simple and clear
- Test with various amount ranges
- Consider business requirements
- Document custom rules

### 2. Performance
- Use database indexes on amount fields
- Cache exchange rates
- Monitor escalation queries
- Optimize approval queries

### 3. Monitoring
- Track approval times
- Monitor escalation rates
- Alert on failed conversions
- Regular rule review

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Currency Conversion Fails**
   - Check API connectivity
   - Verify currency codes
   - Review fallback logic

2. **Escalation Not Working**
   - Verify cron job setup
   - Check escalation_date field
   - Review timezone settings

3. **Approval Rules Not Applied**
   - Check rule configuration
   - Verify amount ranges
   - Review rule priority

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check escalations manually
python manage.py check_escalations

# View approval rules
python manage.py shell
>>> from auth.models import ApprovalRule
>>> ApprovalRule.objects.all()
```
