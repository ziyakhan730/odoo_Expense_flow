Project Description:

This project is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend and Django (with Django REST Framework) for the backend. It features a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions and includes the newly added October functionality for enhanced performance and feature support.

ðŸ”¹ Frontend:

The React.js frontend offers a responsive and user-friendly interface. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and handles routing using React Router. Key features include:

Login and registration forms

Protected routes accessible only to authenticated users

Token storage and automatic token refresh

Error handling and user feedback

October functionality integration for improved UI workflows and dynamic data handling

ðŸ”¹ Backend:

The Django backend uses Django REST Framework (DRF) along with JWT authentication to secure the APIs. It provides:

Token-based authentication using JWT (access & refresh tokens)

Refresh token handling for seamless user experience

Middleware and permissions to restrict access to authenticated users only

API endpoints for login, registration, user details, and other resources

October functionality support to handle new logic and API enhancements introduced in this update

ðŸ”¹ Database:

The application uses SQLite3 as the default database provided by Django for development purposes. It stores all user data, authentication tokens, and other application-related information.

Tech Stack Summary:

Frontend: React.js (with React Router)

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)

Authentication: JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens)

Database: SQLite3

OCR Integration : Google Vision API
